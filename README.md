## 🚀 Projects  

| Project | Description | Tech |
|--------|-------------|------|
| [**Pixelle**](https://github.com/jelius-sama/pixelle-demo) | Open-source Pixiv-like art-sharing platform (with Patreon-style support planned). Currently being rewritten from Next.js to Go+React for a Node-free stack. | Next.js 14 → Go + React + Supabase |
| [**Portfolio**](https://github.com/jelius-sama/Portfolio) | My personal website & portfolio ([jelius.dev](https://jelius.dev)) with achievements, blogs ([/blogs](https://jelius.dev/blogs)), and linktree-style links ([/links](https://jelius.dev/links)). | Go, React, SQLite |
| [**convert_cbz**](https://github.com/jelius-sama/convert_cbz) | CLI tool that converts directories of manga into CBZ archives with a concurrent worker pool. | Pure Go |
| [**VPSWatchDog**](https://github.com/jelius-sama/VPSWatchDog) & [**StorageWatchDog**](https://github.com/jelius-sama/StorageWatchDog) | Resource and storage monitoring daemons with configurable alerts (originally built for my own Maildir). | Go |
| [**AWSMailParser**](https://github.com/jelius-sama/AWSMailParser)| Polls AWS SQS for new mail events, fetches raw emails from S3, and writes them into Maildir for Dovecot. | Go, AWS SDK |

## 📝 Writing  

I document my learning journey and projects on my [blog](https://jelius.dev/blogs):  

- [📦 How I built `convert_cbz` — a concurrent CBZ converter](https://jelius.dev/blog/1a42b1d)  
- [👋 Hello World — First Blog Post](https://jelius.dev/blog/5d4c685)

## 🎯 Current Goals  

- Build a **high-performance Go+React SSR stack** to rival Next.js (without Node.js in production).  
- Experiment with self-hosting & home-labbing (NAS, media servers, personal cloud).  
- Get comfortable with POSIX APIs and low-level system programming.  
- Contribute my fixes & tools upstream when I beat my introvert tendencies.

## 🎮 Fun Facts  

- Anime was what got me into programming — wanted to build a legal anime streaming app back when options were limited.  
- I run Arch Linux (btw) and Neovim — because I like full control.  
- I tinker with servers for fun and sometimes break them for fun too.
